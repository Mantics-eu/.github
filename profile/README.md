## What we’re building

### 🧠 Baticova — dependable AI autonomy
**Baticova** turns AI from isolated tools into **digital departments** that can plan, coordinate, and deliver real work — **transparently and under human control**.  
It’s practical infrastructure for dependable autonomy, shaped by our belief that technology should amplify human collaboration, not replace it.

- **Why it matters:** Today’s AI is powerful but static; it still needs people to manage every step.  
- **Our approach:** transparency, memory, and governance — the three foundations for trustworthy autonomy.  
- **Where it runs:** locally on your device or securely in the cloud.

## How we work

- **Human-centered by design.** Clear UX, calm typography, and thoughtful systems.
- **Open when it helps.** We share research, tools, and docs as they mature.
- **Production-minded.** Demos are great — but we ship things you can actually use.
